## work in progress

GPA is a Python application that aims to quantify GPU performance by detecting frame stutters, primarily during gaming. 
GPA uses data collected by the Nvidia GeForce Experience software that accompanies all Nvidia GPU drivers. 
When the application detects a frame stutter, it aims to deduce the cause of the stutter, and then search for solutions based 
on the most probable causes.
